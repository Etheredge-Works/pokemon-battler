# write agent to not take best move, but take best move amoung available moves and *maybe* set other values to 00

# TODO
- make sure raw stats (stats + base + levels + ivs + evs + nature) are used

- could it be better to just clone and store battles?
- explore reward shaping
- Break out embeddings into separate values for encoding
- fix npbool_ error, likely from embeddings
- add logging to deployed agents
- increase n_battles deployed agents

- increase n for log flushing
