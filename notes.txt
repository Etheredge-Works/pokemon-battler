# write agent to not take best move, but take best move amoung available moves and *maybe* set other values to 00

# TODO
- make sure raw stats (stats + base + levels + ivs + evs + nature) are used

- could it be better to just clone and store battles?
- explore reward shaping
- Break out embeddings into separate values for encoding
- fix npbool_ error, likely from embeddings
- add logging to deployed agents
- increase n_battles deployed agents

- increase n for log flushing
- https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extensions/logging.html#:~:text=you%20want%20to%20track,metrics%20tracking%20within%20LightningModule.

- should have wrapped environment rather than writing stacking logic
- figure out why trainer accelerator dp 2x+ training (maybe not)
- any way to incorporate model based stuff for common ou/uu builds? 
- predicting pokemon moves is a bit of a pain

- add logging of action selections or maybe action weights to see if attacks are chosen more often
- figure out why seems to do batches of 4 on iterator...
- getting rid of num workers kept the bool error to only once at the start
- also seems to have sole the problem of seemingly small batches
- why does it slow down after first eval of players?
- why does showdown log [slow battle]

- could time evaluation and run it ever so many seconds based on how long it takes to run
- profile the training

- add in previous best agent for plotting performance or for training opponent
- TODO add super negative weight for invalid moves instead of just doing a random ones
- does open AI five use stats of characters in their models?
- test how fast 2 random agents can battle each other (how many steps per second)
- parallel agents? the bottle neck seemst o be stepping
- to get self oppoentn working, i need to wrap the env with stacking

# Encodings
## history
- pokemon encoding
- move encoding
- optional
  - damage caused (can be seen in hps)
  - stats changed (can be seen in boosts)
  -

for multi opponents, keep queue of thread links
start new opponent on process and keep link to their id for chalange
when popping off, shut dwon that process

gym can add environment to register environment
